Hello, This is where i would kind of summarize my learnings of what i have been doing in the projects and what i have learned from them.


1) Projectile Motion:
   This was my first ever physics based python project, i learned how to use matplotlib mainly and how to animate the projectile using matplot lib functions
2)Double Pendulam:
   This was my very first complex python project where i learned like utlization of Sympy of assigning varaibles and using Lagrange to derive the equations of motions
   it was first solved by hand in paper then solved it in code in python, learned that python can't solve 2nd order with Sympy odient so i needed to reassign variables which
   was a interesting learning lesson. Learned about the state vector....
3)N-linked Pendulam:
   Not started yet but will be my next project
